<h2>I Make Stuff</h2>
<p>Hi. I'm Armienn, and I have too many ideas and too little time.</p>
<p>Throughout the years I've spent some time making small drawings, programs, games, systems and who knows what.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<a href="https://armienn.github.io/pokemon"><h3>Pokémon Stuff</h3></a>
<p>This basically an advanced list of Pokémon. It's from 2018, so it's outdated by now, but it's still rather useful if you're playing a game from before gen 8</p>
<a href="renderend"><h3>Renderend</h3></a>
<p>This is a small original game inspired by the trench run from Star Wars.</p>
<a href="https://armienn.github.io/SyllabicNumerals"><h3>Syllabic Numerals</h3></a>
<p>This is a simple system I designed for making long numbers easier to remember.</p>
<a href="https://armienn.github.io/SyllabicNumerals"><h3>Eld</h3></a>
<p>This is a game I'm currently working on from time to time. It is not in a proper playable state yet, but I do like what I've got so far.</p>
